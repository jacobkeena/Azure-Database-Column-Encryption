# Azure-Database-Column-Encryption

This was a quick tutorial recommended by a mentor of mine. This was my first time seeing and using encryption in a database environment
so I found this pretty interesting! I included a screenshot of what the database looks like after it has been encrypted if anyone 
is interested. (/Screenshots) 

P.S.
This isn't code written by me. Tutorial is located at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted
if anyone is interested in checking it out!
